I arrived at your bed to give you a quiet wake up and you were\nmaking smeh-smeh with me. I said let me give you some few minutes and yet you\nare still there?! I am counting to three, better not let me finish.”\nKai! Which kind wahala is this?! Early on a Monday morning too. I wonder what\nset her ablaze so quickly .  .  .\n“One!”\nThe warmth and comfort of my bed had made it like Bro Collins, who always\ncheated when we wrestled and refused to let me go when I tapped the ground, the\nsign of submission.\n“Two!!”\nI hear her footsteps coming in the direction of my room.\n“Two and a half!!!”\nFreedom!!!!!!!\nThe ube-coloured curtain that seals my room from the rest of our small house is\npulled aside.\nShe stood in the doorway, the corners of her lips down-turned, on the verge of\nparting, the suppression of a smile. “Ok, so you’re awake?”\n\nI set off from the house, lunch in one hand, trumpet case in the other. Mummy,\nit still felt strange calling her that, had made her special jollof rice this\nmorning. When I asked why, she replied, with that playful glint in her eye:\n“when you realise, later today, that you forgot to eat lunch in your\nnervousness, you can thank me.” She didn’t really answer my question but then\nagain, everyone told me that she sometimes answered questions in advance or with\n. . . .\nMy thoughts were suddenly interrupted by the loud sound of a truck horn.\nAs everyone turned to find the direction it came from, a large ball of laughter\nerupted from the group of Keke Napep drivers across the road. They had crowded\naround one particular Keke, which had Engr. Anjous in the driver seat. As the\nfits of laughter died down, he did a mock-bow before pressing a button on his\nhandle-bars , once again filling the Monday morning harmattan air with the\nelephantine bellow of the truck horn.\n“Engr Anjous! You don crase?!” shouted one of the pure-water sellers from the\nother side of the street.\n“No o my broada! I just dey show this my super-horn! Na how I go take clear road\ntoday!!” he yelled back.\n“Anjous! You and these your paraphernliums!” the seller said as he shook his\nhead. As I looked in his direction again, Engr Anjous waved and I returned the\ngesture.\nEngr Anjous wasn’t really an engineer. Not by training anyway. He was, however,\nalways tinkering with his Keke. Only three weeks ago, I heard that he put what\nlooked like a small fan on the top of his Keke and charged other drivers\nbatteries off it during the early morning sea breeze. Everyone called him crazy\nfor doing that but by the time Faji came round last Friday, and so many Keke \ndrivers bought him drinks as thanks, he was the one laughing the loudest.\n\nThe laughter of Engr Anjous and the other Keke drivers melted away in the\nassault on the senses that was the motor park. Although it was only 6:45, long\nqueues had started to form by the sides of many buses. As I headed toward the\nbus that would take me close to school, I walked past the square that had been\nnicknamed “CNN”. Here, several commuters stood over the open pages of newspapers\nthey were too broke to afford.\n“My friend will you remove your hand from my paper?!” spat a newspaper vendor at\na man who had just tried to turn the pages of one his open papers.\n“You know say na N10 a page, just pay if you want to see the other side”, he\ncontinued.\n“My broda, money no dey like that o”, replied the commuter.\n“Ehn, then look but don’t touch!”, finished the vendor.\nI smiled as I saw some commuters in the debate corner of CNN, angrily but\npeacefully expressing their opinions. One of the newspaper vendors had been\nreading the political section to those gathered in the debate corner,\noccasionally pausing to let his listeners punctuate his sentences with their “na\nwa os” and “chais”. Ordinarily I would have gone to listen for a little bit but\ntoday, the assessment I had coming up weighed heavily on my mind.\n\n“Okesco!!!!” was the joyful shout of Bro Collins as he saw me approach his \nDanfo.\n“How body?”, he asked.\n“I’m fine, just . . . ”, my words trailed off.\n“Ahn, Okesco! Wetin? Who stole the meat from your bowl of soup?” he asked.\nI chuckled.\n“Broda nobody o. I’m just afraid for this exam I have today”, I replied. “It’s\nfor the place of lead trumpeter for our school’s marching band. There’s one\nother girl competing with me for it, and she’s really good.”\n“So what? It doesn’t . . .” Bro Collins stopped mid-sentence. “Oke the bus is\nfull, let’s start going, go to the front.”\n\n“Chief (H)Oke!”\n“Hello Uncle Sukirat”, I said through a half-smile. Uncle Sukirat was the driver\nfor the Danfo Bro Collins worked as conductor on. The big northern Yoruba man\nwith a strong h-factor and toothy grin was always seen with a Fila on his head.\nSome people said it contained juju that brought lots of passengers to his Danfo \nbut I knew he just had a bad hairline and wanted to, as he described it:\n“(h)operate like (h)a big man.”\n“Haaah, (H)Oke. Who thiefed the petrol from your car this morning?” he asked,\ninquiring into my apparent unease.\n“Nobody Uncle, I just have a test today”, I said as he started the bus and we\nset off.\n\n“’Ello burriful passengers!” announced Bro Collins as we started to move.\n“Oga conductor”, one replied, “this one wey you dey wash us for morry, know say\nwe don already bath o!”\n“Hmm!” another continued, “are we safe?”\n“No need to worry burriful people”, Collins said in the wake of his own chuckle,\n“it’s just my little brother here. Fear dey catch am, because he has test today,\nabeg anyone get word for am?”\n“I have a brother who lives in Okija, near the shrine”, one passenger chimed in,\n“he can arrange something for. . .”\n“My friend will you shut up there!!”, another passenger interrupted. “Idiot!!!\nYou want to start teaching this pikin about juju?!” He kissed his teeth, a long\nloud hiss of disgust escaping his lips.\n“Young man, just go there and show them that you have prepared for this day”,\nsaid a well-dressed elderly man at the back of the bus.\nThe other passengers hummed and nodded in agreement.\n“Show them say Khaki, no be leather”, added another student who was dressed in\nuniform like me.\n“Bros!” shouted a passenger who was wearing sunglasses in the bus, even though\nit was a very cloudy morning. “Wetin you dey fear, I can see that ogbonge \nswaggah for your body! Wetin sele? You knack that test one time. Two times sef,\nif they want it!”\nAll the passengers laughed in agreement. As the laughter started to die down, a\nmiddle-aged lady spoke up. She had the kind of face that told its own story and\nfrom the look in her eyes you knew that she had seen many things. All the\npassengers must have felt this too, for as she spoke, the bus remained quiet.\n“Young man, what kind of test is it?” she asked.\n“It’s a musical one, ma”, I answered. “I have to play a song on my trumpet\nwithout making any mistake. If I make a mistake I don’t get to be the lead\ntrumpeter for my school’s marching band.”\n“That does indeed sound difficult.” She replied.\n“Yes, ma.”\n“What’s your dream?”\n“My dream?”\n“Yes, your dream as a trumpeter.”\n“I’d love to play like some of the Jazz musicians I hear on Cool FM.”\n“Do you like playing the trumpet?”\nI paused for a second.\n“Yes I do.” I said. “I really do.” I felt like I had forgotten that playing was\nwhat I really loved to do.\n“Well young man, go there and play your heart out.” She continued, “whether or\nnot you get the position is immaterial.”\nShe saw the confusion on my face.\n“By immaterial I mean that you enjoy what you do. This position would be\nexciting and nice to have but it won’t stop you from achieving what you really\nwant with your playing.”\n“Oke.”, Bro Collins spoke up, “we don reach your junction.”\n\nI got off the bus and turned round to thank Bro Collins, Uncle Sukirat and the\npassengers. As I did so Bro Collins said: “abeg people make we give the man\nsmall claps for ‘im spirit.” The passengers clapped and cheered, as the bus\nbegan to pull away, Mr-Sunglasses shouted: “Make them no say you get ground!\nWater don pass garri today!!”\nI looked fondly at my trumpet case, yes I loved playing.","html":"<p>Have you ever heard the wind whisper your name? “Oke . . . ” In the deafening silence of my dream, it was a very welcome change.  I hear the gentle whisper twice more before it suddenly becomes a howl.<br>“OKE!”<br>The pessimist in me says I’m half-awake.<br>“OKE!!”.<br>Now I’m awake.<br>“Yes Mummy?” I reply.<br>“Okewalechukwu!
